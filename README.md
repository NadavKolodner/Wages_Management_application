# Wages_Management_application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.22.

## An explination before use

The application functions by taking an input in the begining of either a company name that has been created by the program and stored in local storage or by typing "headquarters" (HQ)

The HQ can, from their page, create, delete, and view all of the companies in their greater organization. Use of the refresh chart button can display changes after they take place.

After the HQ creates a "company" the company can go to the page and type in their name to be greeted with a page to add, manage, edit, and view all users in a nice and organized manor.

When you first visit the page in a browser, you must type "headquarters" in order to start creating organizations.
