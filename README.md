## An explination before use

The application functions by taking an input in the begining of either a company name that has been created by the program and stored in local storage or by typing "headquarters" (HQ)

The HQ can, from their page, create, delete, and view all of the companies in their greater organization.

After a company is created by the HQ, they can refresh the page and type in that name to be greeted with a page to add, manage, edit, and view all users in a nice and organized manor.
